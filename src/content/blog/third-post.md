We've all seen it (or perhaps even written it): a `div` or `span` element, perhaps with a click handler, meticulously styled to look exactly like a button. While visually it might pass, beneath the surface lies an accessibility nightmare and a missed opportunity for robust, maintainable code.

In this article, we're going to champion the humble `<button>` element. We'll start by stripping away all its default browser styling, then carefully add back the visual cues that scream "I'm clickable!" â€“ all while retaining its inherent semantic power. Finally, we'll explore the rare but crucial scenarios where a `div` or `span` does need to become interactive, and how ARIA steps in to save the day.

## The Problem with "Div-Buttons"

When you use a `div` or `span` and attach a JavaScript click event, you're essentially creating a custom interactive control from scratch. This means you lose:

- **Keyboard Navigability**: Users can't Tab to it.
- **Screen Reader Annunciation**: Screen readers won't announce it as a "button," nor will they inform the user of its state.
- **Built-in Accessibility Features**: Things like the `disabled` attribute, form submission behavior, and default click handling are gone.
- **Browser Consistency**: Each browser styles native buttons slightly differently, which, while sometimes annoying, provides a baseline of recognition for users.

## Starting with a Blank Canvas: The Unstyled Button

Let's begin by taking a standard `<button>` and mercilessly stripping away all its default browser styling. This allows us to appreciate its raw semantic value and build our visual design from the ground up, much like a `div`.

Here's the CSS to achieve this:

```css
button {
  /* Remove default background, border, and padding */
  background: none;
  border: none;
  padding: 0;

  /* Inherit font styles from parent, don't use system defaults */
  font: inherit;
  color: inherit; /* Ensure text color is inherited */
  
  /* Remove browser-specific "appearance" */
  -webkit-appearance: none;
  -moz-appearance: none;
  appearance: none;

  /* Ensure the text alignment is inherited, not centered by default */
  text-align: inherit;

  /* Keep the pointer cursor for interaction */
  cursor: pointer;

  /* IMPORTANT: While removing the outline helps styling,
     you MUST add custom focus styles for accessibility! */
  outline: none; 
}
```

Now, if you render a `<button>` with this CSS, it will look indistinguishable from a `div` containing text.

What you see visually are two pieces of text. But semantically, one is a robust, interactive control, and the other is just text. The magic of the `<button>` remains: it's still keyboard focusable and announced correctly by screen readers.

## Styling It Back: Adding Visual Cues to Semantic Power

Now that our button looks like a `div`, let's add back the styling that makes it visually obvious it's a button. This isn't just for aesthetics; it's a core accessibility requirement. We need to satisfy two major principles: users must be able to identify the component, and they must be able to operate it.

### To "Look Like a Button" (Identification)

Simply having text on a page isn't enough. A user needs to visually identify it as an interactive control. This relates directly to **WCAG 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast (AA)**, which requires that the visual boundaries of user interface components (like our button) have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against their surroundings. By adding a `background-color` or a `border`, we are creating that essential boundary.

### To "Act Like a Button" (Operation)

When we removed the default outline, we removed the browser's built-in focus indicator. **WCAG 2.4.7 Focus Visible (AA)** requires that any keyboard-operable interface has a visible focus indicator. Therefore, it's not optional; we must add our own clear and highly-visible focus style to show keyboard users where they are on the page.

With those requirements in mind, let's add our styles back:

```css
/* Our base unstyled button from before */
button {
  background: none;
  border: none;
  padding: 0;
  font: inherit;
  color: inherit;
  -webkit-appearance: none;
  -moz-appearance: none;
  appearance: none;
  text-align: inherit;
  cursor: pointer;
  outline: none; /* Remember: this MUST be replaced */
}

/* Add our custom button styling */
.my-custom-button {
  background-color: #007bff; /* A nice blue background */
  color: white; /* White text for contrast */
  padding: 8px 16px; /* Some internal spacing */
  border-radius: 4px; /* Slightly rounded corners */
  transition: background-color 0.2s ease-in-out; /* Smooth hover effect */
  display: inline-block; /* Treat it like a block, but inline flow */

  /* This 'background-color' creates the boundary, 
     helping to meet WCAG 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast */
}

.my-custom-button:hover {
  background-color: #0056b3; /* Darker blue on hover */
}

/* This is our non-negotiable replacement for the default outline, 
   meeting WCAG 2.4.7 Focus Visible */
.my-custom-button:focus-visible {
  outline: 3px solid #0056b3; /* A clear, thick outline */
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

And now, apply it to our semantic button:

```html
<button class="my-custom-button">Click Me Semantically!</button>
```

The result? You have a beautifully styled button that looks exactly how you want but now explicitly meets accessibility criteria for both identification (Non-text Contrast) and operation (Focus Visible), all while retaining the free benefits of a native HTML `<button>`.

## The Benefits of Semantic Buttons

- **Accessibility Out-of-the-Box**: This is the big one. Screen readers understand buttons. Keyboard users can interact with them. It significantly lowers the barrier for inclusive design.
- **Robustness**: Buttons have native states (`:hover`, `:active`, `:focus`, `:disabled`) that are easy to style and understand.
- **Less JavaScript**: You don't need complex JavaScript to manage focus, keyboard events (like Enter or Spacebar for activation), or the disabled state. The browser handles it.
- **Developer Experience**: It's clearer, more concise, and easier to maintain. When you see `<button>`, you immediately know its purpose.
- **Future-Proofing**: Browsers and assistive technologies evolve. Relying on native elements means your components are more likely to work correctly as new standards emerge.

## When a Div or Span Does Need ARIA

While the `<button>` element should be your default for anything that performs an action, there are legitimate scenarios where you might use a `div` or `span` for interactivity. This usually happens when:

- **Custom Widgets**: You're building a highly custom UI component that doesn't map directly to a native HTML element (e.g., a complex drag-and-drop interface, a tab panel, a custom dropdown with advanced features, a rich text editor).
- **Non-Actionable "Clicks"**: Sometimes a click isn't an "action" in the traditional sense, but rather a way to reveal more content or navigate in a non-standard way within an existing content block.

In these situations, you lose the browser's built-in semantics, and it becomes your responsibility to reintroduce them using **WAI-ARIA** (Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes.

For example, if you have a `div` that functions like a button (but for some very specific design reason cannot be a `<button>`):

```html
<div role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="Add new item">
  +
</div>
```

Here's what each ARIA attribute does:

- **`role="button"`**: Tells assistive technologies that this `div` should be treated as a button.
- **`tabindex="0"`**: Makes the `div` focusable via keyboard (Tab key).
- **`aria-label="Add new item"`**: Provides an accessible name for the button, especially important if its visual content (`+` in this case) isn't descriptive enough.

You would also need to manually add JavaScript to handle both click events and keydown events for Enter and Spacebar to fully emulate a native button's behavior. As you can see, it's significantly more work to make a `div` behave like a button than to just use a `<button>` in the first place!

## Conclusion

For 99% of interactive elements that trigger an action, the `<button>` element is your best friend. Embrace its semantic power, style it to your heart's content, and provide an accessible experience by default. Reserve `div` and `span` with ARIA for the truly custom, complex widgets where native HTML simply doesn't offer a suitable alternative. Your users, your fellow developers, and your future self will thank you.
